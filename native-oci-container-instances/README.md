GraalVM on OCI Container Instances Demo
=============================
This demo will walk you through the process of containerizing a Native Image application and then launching the image on the OCI platform by using the Container Instance service. In this demo, you will deploy a simple "Hello World" HTTP application and have the ability to see details about its performance.

Prerequisites
----------------------
Ensure that you have the following installed and follow the linked instructions for any that you are missing:
- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
- GraalVM: https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/
- Your OCI account also must have the proper permissions to create container instances; follow this guide to grant access: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/container-instances/permissions/policy-reference.htm#examples__let-users-create-container-instances

**COMPATIBILITY**: Please ensure that you are completing this demo on an architecture that will create compiled binaries that are compatible with the OCI Container Instances platform for proper functionality

Download or clone GraalVM demos repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
```

Micronaut "Hello World" Application
----------------------
The code provided in this demo is a simple "Hello World" REST application created using the Micronaut framework. To understand what the code is doing, take a look at the _Application.java_ and _HelloController.java_ files:

**Application.java**

<img width="469" alt="Application.java" src="https://github.com/egadbois/graalvm-demos/assets/134104678/a330ab66-c3d0-43ac-91ce-4abf11685234">

This is the location of the main() function and entry point for the application.

**HelloController.java**

<img width="497" alt="HelloController.java" src="https://github.com/egadbois/graalvm-demos/assets/134104678/e48d3a98-99e0-44ca-8b6c-2abdd07fa5dd">

This code implements the actual RESTful "Hello World" functionality. It produces the "Hello World" string when a GET request is made to the "/hello" URL.

Configure authentication
----------------------
1. Open the OCI [dashboard](https://cloud.oracle.com/) and login to your profile
2. Open the Profile menu on the top-right of the screen and click "User Settings"
3. Under "Auth Tokens", click "Generate Token"
4. After choosing a description, the token will be presented to you. Immediately copy the token to a secure location because you will not be able to view it again in the console
5. On your local machine's terminal (where Docker is installed), login to the Registry:
```sh
docker login <region-key>.ocir.io
```
For a list of all region keys, [click here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Concepts/registryprerequisites.htm#regional-availability)

6. When prompted for a username, provide yours in the format:
```sh
<tenancy-namespace>/<username>
```
Tenancy namespace can be found on the [Tenancy Information](https://cloud.oracle.com/tenancy) page if you do not know it

7. Use the authorization token to created previously as the password when prompted

Deploy a Native Image Container on OCI Container Registry
----------------------
1. Navigate to the directory for this demo:
```sh
cd graalvm-demos/native-oci-instances
```

__OPTIONAL__: In the next step you will use a single command to build the application into a container image and deploy it to the repository you have created; if you would like to first view the Docker file that will be used to create the image, run the following command:
```sh
./mvnw mn:dockerfile -Dpackaging=docker-native
```
The newly created Dockerfile will be automatically stored in the "target" directory

2. Build the container image and push it to the OCI registry (```<repo-name>``` may be an existing repository or any name for a repository that will be created upon pushing the image):
```sh
./mvnw deploy -Dpackaging=docker-native -Djib.to.image=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>
```
3. On a browser, visit the OCI dashboard and open the side menu to locate "Developer Services" -> "Containers & Artifacts" -> "Container Registry"
4. Select the directory in which you stored your image (the location corresponds to the ```<tenancy-namespace>``` that you tagged the image with)
5. Ensure that the Access type is "Public"; if it is not, click "Actions" in the top-right corner and select "Change to public"

Create an OCI Container Instance
-------------------------
1. From the main OCI dashboard, open the side menu and click on "Developer Services" -> "Containers & Artifacts" -> "Container Instances"

2. Click "Create container instance"
3. Input a name and compartment location for the instance
4. In the "Shape" section, adjust the sliders to your desired amounts of OCPUs and Memory (For this demo, 4 OCPUs and 128 GBs will be plenty)
