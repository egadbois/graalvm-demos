GraalVM on AWS Lambda Demo
====================
This demo will walk you through the processes for deploying both Java 17 and Native Image applications onto the AWS Lambda platform. In this demo, you will deploy a simple "Hello World" HTTP application and have the ability to compare how the versions of the application compare based on speed and size.

Prerequisites
----------------------
Ensure that you have the following installed and follow the linked instructions for any that you are missing:
- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
- Apache Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html

1. Download and install the latest GraalVM JDK with Native Image using the [GraalVM JDK Downloader](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-jdk-downloader).
    ```bash
    bash <(curl -sL https://get.graalvm.org/jdk) 
    ```
2. Download or clone GraalVM demos repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
    ```

Deploying a Java 17 Application (.jar)
----------------------
1. Navigate to the directory for this demo:
```
cd graalvm-demos/aws-lambda-demo
```
2. Generate the .jar application file by executing the following command (the file will be created in aws-lambda-demo/target):
```
mvn package
```
3. Sign-in to [Amazon Web Services](https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=ca-central-1#/discover) and navigate to the Lambda dashboard

4.	Select the “Create function” button in the top-right corner
5.	Select “Author from scratch”, choose a name for your function, select “Java 17” as the runtime, and select “x86_64” as the architecture

6.	On the page for your newly created function, navigate to the section titled “Code source” and select the “Upload from .zip or.jar file” button
![Code upload](https://github.com/egadbois/graalvm-demos/assets/134104678/13827b9c-c09e-45b2-ac49-2c39b56d33ff)
7.	Click upload and navigate to where you stored the function.jar file that you downloaded then select “upload” and “save”
8.	Under “Runtime settings”, click “Edit” and input “io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautLambdaHandler” as the Handler

9.	Now you can go ahead and test the function. To do so, navigate to the “Test” tab and select “Create new event”. Choose a name for your test and input the following as the contents of the “Event JSON” box:
```
{
  "path": "/",
  "httpMethod": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "application/json"
  }
}
```

10.	Click “Save” in the top-right corner to save your test and click “Test” to ensure that the application works correctly. You should receive an output that indicates a success and provides information about the performance of the application:

Deploying a Native Image Application
----------------------------------
1. Navigate to the directory for this demo:
```
cd graalvm-demos/aws-lambda-demo
```
2. AWS Lambda requires a bootstrap file that provides instructions for running applications with custom runtimes. Generate a zip file containing the Native Image executable and a corresponding bootstrap file with the following command (the file will be created in aws-lambda-demo/target):
```
mvn package -Dpackaging=docker-native
```
3. Sign-in to [Amazon Web Services](https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=ca-central-1#/discover) and navigate to the Lambda dashboard

4.	Select the “Create function” button in the top-right corner
5.	Select “Author from scratch”, choose a name for your function, select “Provide your own bootstrap on Amazon Linux 2” as the runtime, and choose “x86_64” as the architecture
